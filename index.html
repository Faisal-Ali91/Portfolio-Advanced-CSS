        <p>My name is Faisal Sabar Ali and I live in Birmingham, United Kingdom. I have spent most of my life in Birmingham
            and have studied accounting but discovered it wasn't for me. I have worked in the civil service since 2016 and
            it dawned on me during the COVID-pandemic that I need to gain skills in an industry that I have a passion for. I have
            always been interested in coding and the world that it can create so I decided to enter this world.
        </p>

        <p>I started my Coding-Bootcamp course in May 2021 and so far I have completed the first unit of HTML and advanced CSS
            and I am currently mid-way through my Javascript unit. I am currently studying intensively whilst working full-time
            and running a household. My dream is to get a job in the Software-Development world at the conclusion of this bootcamp
            or even during it. I believe that I am hard-working and have the ability to learn and then re-learn when more adequate
            information arises.
